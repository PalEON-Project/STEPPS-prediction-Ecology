        <horizpar>There is a diversity of national data sources in this product. Although the data accuracy varies, the data generally have high enough horizontal accuracy to support NMAS and mapping at 1:24,000 scale. NMAS horizontal accuracy requires that at least 90 percent of well-defined points tested are within 0.02 inch of the true position.</horizpar>

        <vertaccr>Contours are generated from the National Elevation Dataset (NED). The most recently published figure of overall absolute vertical accuracy of the NED within the conterminous US, expressed as the root mean square error (RMSE) of 25,310 reference points is 1.55 meters. However, the vertical accuracy actually varies significantly across the US because of differences in source quality, terrain relief, land cover, and other factors. Details of this analysis are published in "Accuracy Assessment of the U.S. Geological Survey National Elevation Dataset, and Comparison with Other Large-Area Elevation Datasets-SRTM and ASTER: U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report 2014-1008," http://pubs.usgs.gov/2014.1008/ .</vertaccr>

            <othercit>
              This contour feature class was generated from the 1/3 arc-second version of the
              3D Elevation Program. The intended viewing scale for these features is 1:24,000. The
              contours are derived from a filtered elevation raster to achieve smoother arcs. In some areas, the
              3DEP data may be modified by the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) flow lines and water bodies
              to facilitate improved integration between the hypsography and hydrography on USGS map
              products. These contours were generated primarily for use as a layer in GeoPDFs created in the
              digital mapping program. The raster data source of contours is the 3D Elevation Program
              1/3 arc-second layer. Secondary datasets include the high resolution flow lines, water bodies, and areas from the
              National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). The NHD layers are used in hydro-enforcement of the DEM
              prior to contour generation. The goals of the hydro-enforcement are to prevent contour lines from
              extending over the surface of water bodies and to align the contour reentrants with the NHD single-
              line streams. The 3DEP raster cells are converted to points. Those points, along with the NHD flow
              lines are input into an interpolation tool to create a new surface. The NHD water bodies and areas
              are preprocessed to attach the minimum and maximum elevation to each polygon. From these
              precalculated values, an appropriate value is calculated by which to raise the elevation cells under
              the NHD polygons. The NHD polygons are then converted into rasters, which in turn will be used to
              generate a mosaic that includes the new raster surface. The mosaic is filtered to provide smoother
              contour lines. Contours are generated and depression and index contours are identified. There is no
              guarantee or warranty concerning the accuracy of the data.  Users should be aware that temporal
              changes may have occurred since these data were collected and generated and that some parts of
              these data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Hydro-enforcement and
              generalization can also significantly alter the spatial characteristics of the contours. Users should not
              use these data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations.

            <othercit>The boundary is a digital representation of the International boundary between the United States and Canada as per the Treaty of 1908. It has been generated from a combination of recent surveys and datum conversions. It is intended for general mapping purposes only. The boundary dataset is composed of 29 segments that correspond to the original 256 boundary maps. Attributes of each segment define the scale in which the line in that area may be accurately depicted. It is produced for mapping purposes only and not intended to illustrate the boundary beyond the limits of the scale for any given segment</othercit>

            <geoform>vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The international boundary between Mexico and the United States, defined as a joint venture between the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia of Mexico (INEGI), resulted in an unofficial United States-Mexico boundary dataset that was further enhanced by the U.S. Geological Survey's Border Environmental Health Initiative (BEHI). With the data frame scale set to 1:5,000 in ArcMap, the center of the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo was digitized using the NAIP 2004 Imagery. In areas with dense stands of salt cedar (bounding box = UL -104.714 30.038, UR -104.664 30.037, LR -104.666 29.933, LL -104.717 29.934; NAD83), the center of the channel was difficult, and sometimes impossible, to easily determine. To determine the location of the boundary, the GIS analyst compared the location of the line in the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class with the NAIP 2004 Imagery and adjusted the boundary to the image, thus, the delineation of the international boundary is less certain in these areas. The remaining part of the border was extracted from the INEGI 1:250K Limite feature class and appended to the line feature class created along the Rio Grande/Rio Bravo. The U.S. Geological Survey reviewed the original USDA data against 2007 NAIP imagery and further edited 9 line segments in the Rio Grande areas to conform to National Map Accuracy Standards.</othercit>

            <othercit>This dataset depicts the authoritative boundaries of the most commonly known Department of Defense (DoD) sites, installations, ranges, and training areas in the United States and Territories. These sites encompass land which is federally owned or otherwise managed. This dataset was compiled by the Defense Installation Spatial Data Infrastructure (DISDI) Program. This dataset represents the baseline for georeferenced boundaries of sites selected from the 2010 Base Structure Report. The boundary locations are intended for planning purposes only and do not represent the legal or surveyed land parcel boundaries. This list does not necessarily represent a comprehensive collection of all DoD facilities, and only those in the fifty United States and US Territories were considered for inclusion. Maps produced at a scale of 1:50,000 or larger which otherwise comply with National Map Accuracy Standards will remain compliant if this data is incorporated. Although these data have been provided by the DoD components, no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the utility of the data on any other system, in derived products or data alterations, nor shall the act of distribution constitute such warranty.</othercit>

The USGS converted areas of generally 3 acres or less to point features to facilitate cartographic display on the US Topo digital map product. See Source URL for link to complete dataset. This data set is complete but subject to continual updates to reflect boundary amendments, legislation, and acquisitions, and improved processing techniques. The data is being regularly updated with verified boundaries from NPS Land Resources Division. The data is intended for use as a tool for display and general GIS analysis purposes only. It is in no way intended for engineering or legal purposes. The data accuracy is checked against best available sources which may be dated. NPS assumes no liability for use of this data. Boundaries from the Land Resources Division have separate polygons for each type of unit. For example Denali National Park and Denali National Preserve are separate individual polygons.</othercit>

            <othercit>This data set depicts simplified boundaries of lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service including National Wildlife Refuges, National Fish Hatcheries, FWS administrative sites, and other conservation areas. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuge Boundaries data set depicts the legislative boundary of the 16 National Wildlife Refuges in Alaska at a source scale of 1:63,360. The dataset was created by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Region 7, Division of Realty and Natural Resources. The USGS substituted the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge boundaries for the USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries in Alaska for cartographic purposes. The USFWS Simplified Wildlife Refuge Boundaries are simplified from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Real Estate Interest data layer containing polygons representing tracts of land (parcels) in which the Service has a property or management interest. These interests include full land ownership, secondary interests in property primarily managed and reported by other federal agencies, leased property, property managed by agreement with other parties, and, within National Wildlife Refuges, property governed by conservation easements. A conservation easement is a permanent, legally enforceable land preservation agreement between a landowner and a government agency that restricts real estate, commercial and industrial development of the land, which remains private property. Inholdings of private property within Refuge areas not covered by conservation easements are excluded from these boundaries. The Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge and Waterfowl production area easements acquired through the small wetlands program have been omitted. Interior boundaries between parcels were dissolved to produce a single set of simplified external boundaries for each feature. These are resource grade mapping representations of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service boundaries. For legal descriptions of the land represented here contact the USFWS Realty Office. This map layer was compiled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Alaska National Wildlife Refuges dataset was derived from the following digital sources and legal documents: 1) Federal Register, Vol. 48, No. 38 Thursday, February 24, 1983 Notices Pages 7890-8029. 2) USGS 1:250,000 scale Alaska Boundary Series maps entitled: Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act December 2, 1980 P.L. 96-487 3) Various legal documents such as survey plats, legal metes and bounds descriptions, Deeds, and Titles. 4) USGS 1:63,360 scale revised hydrography Digital Line Graphs depicting ground conditions from 1955 to 1986. Although these Fish and Wildlife boundaries represent lands administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, not all areas are open to the public. Some fragile habitats need to be protected from human traffic, some management areas are closed, and the terms of some conservation easements preclude public access. The public is urged to contact specific Refuges or other conservation areas before visiting.</othercit>

            <othercit>The PLSS information is for general reference purposes only, and should not be used to determine legal boundaries or land ownership. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is the authoritative source for PLSS information at the federal level, and the US Topo representation is derived from BLM GIS data files called Cadastral National Spatial Data Infrastructure or CadNSDI. The management of these data is not completely uniform throughout the country. Although this metadata record is included with all maps, PLSS is currently shown on US Topo Maps for only a few states. PLSS will be added to US Topo maps in more states in coming years as BLM authorized CadNSDI format is made available. The three layers USGS stores from PLSS are the Township, First Division and Special Surveys. Metadata for BLM PLSS data is at http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/metadata/index.htm#PLSS, though this URL may change in the near future. Alternate sources of PLSS data will continued to be served mainly in western states where BLM is the data steward or the data is from a trusted source. Notes on individual states follow,----Alaska PLSS consists of protracted (computed, not surveyed) data only. For more information see http://sdms.ak.blm.gov/sdms/data_protracted_grid_gis.html----Ohio was the original PLSS state in the early 1800s, and the land network there is unusually complex. The source data include four first-division parcel types. These are all shown on US Topo maps, and are labeled according to BLM's attribution, with a leading letter followed by either a number or more letters. The meanings of the leading letters are S=Section, F=Fractional Section, L=Lot, Q=Quarter Township.</othercit>

            <othercit>The Woodland Tint is a derivative land cover product created using several national map layers: three National Land Cover Database (NLCD) 2001 raster layers (Tree Canopy, Imperviousness, and Land Cover); and two vector layers (National Hydrography Dataset and Transportation). The process begins with masking the NLCD 2001 Canopy Data with NLCD 2001 Imperviousness V1 (values from 1-100), and Land Cover V1 (value 11 = Open Water). The resulting raster data with canopy values of 20 and greater are converted to woodland vector polygons and smoothed via the Paek Algorithm. The woodland polygons are masked with buffered Transportation (Roads, Airport Runways, and Railroads) and Hydrography (NHD Areas excluding Inundation Area and NHD Waterbodies excluding Swamp/Marsh). The resulting polygons are checked for scale appropriate size (minimum size of one acre), and the small woodland polygons as well as small clearings within the woodland polygons are deleted.</othercit>

            <othercit>The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. The high-resolution NHD was originally created using 1:24,000-scale data. State and Local Stewards are improving the data by incorporating local updates based on more current and more accurate source data. Water features in the real world are relatively dynamic and the differences at the time of data collection mean that water features may not register exactly to other layers. The hydrographic feature names contained in and displayed by the NHD are extracted and validated from the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS). Spatial objects may be filtered or generalized to achieve a 1:24,000-scale representation.</othercit>

            <othercit>This dataset, termed "GAGES II", an acronym for Geospatial Attributes of Gages for Evaluating Streamflow, version II, provides geospatial data and classifications for 9,322 stream gages maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It is an update to the original GAGES in 2010. The GAGES II dataset consists of gages which have had either 20+ complete years (not necessarily continuous) of discharge record since 1950, or are currently active, as of water year 2009, and whose watersheds lie within the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Only active stations, as identified by the GAGES II dataset, are symbolized.</othercit>

            <othercit>Railroads are derived from an unpublished data set provided to USGS by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Geographic Information Science and Technology Group (GIST). Following is an excerpt from the GIST description of the data set; the original data contain attributes not used by US Topo: The rail lines layer represents the freight lines of the nation's railroad system. The data set covers all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as territories and possessions of the United States. No rail lines exist in American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands of the US. Phase 1 of this product is a completed deliverable. This phase involved adding and validating network attribute data including railroad ownership, trackage and haulage rights, operational status, operating subdivisions, signaling systems, track class and traffic density. Phase 2 adjusted the topological alignment of the track using the best available remote sensing imagery. Information originally based on the Department of Transportation (DOT) Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) 1:100K rail network. The data have been updated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Geographic Information Science and Technology Group (GIST).</othercit>

            <geoform>Vector digital data</geoform>
            <othercit>The first recreational trails were added to US Topo maps in 2013. The data for trails come from a variety of sources. Accuracy and currency is the responsibility of the data owner; USGS evaluates the authoritativeness of the source but does not independently verify data accuracy. Trails are not complete, and will not be complete for the foreseeable future. Trails will be added as data become available from land management agencies and other authoritative sources. All recreational trails information presented on US Topo maps is public domain, though the original source data is not necessarily public domain. This metadata section documents all data sources for all maps, not this specific map. Trails listed here are not guaranteed to be present on all relevant maps, due to schedule differences between data delivery and US Topo production schedules. Feature-level metadata is not provided in the US Topo product; there is no link between a line on the map and the source of that specific trail. Notes on data sources follow --------- For the 11 National Scenic Trails (NST): Ice Age National Scenic Trail: data provided by the volunteer organization Ice Age Trail Alliance, http://www.iceagetrail.org, in cooperation with National Park Service and Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. - Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail: unpublished data provided by US Forest Service - Appalachian National Scenic Trail: data published by the Appalachian Trial Conservancy, http://appalachiantrail.org/about-the-trail/mapping-gis-data, in cooperation with National Park Service - North Country National Scenic Trail: unpublished dataset provided by National Park Service - Arizona National Scenic Trail: data from AZGEO Clearinghouse, https://azgeo.az.gov/azgeo/, in cooperation with U.S. Forest Service - Pacific Northwest National Scenic Trail: unpublished data provided by US Forest Service - Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail: unpublished dataset provided by National Park Service --------- For other trail types and sources: US Fish and Wildlife Service lands: the USFWS Hiking Trails Inventory is administered by the US Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, and Pacific Western Technologies, LTD. The purpose of the dataset is to create a baseline inventory of all non-motorized trails on US Fish and Wildlife Service Stations. - US Forest Service lands: trails within National Forests are from unpublished data provided by USFS. These data are developed from sources of differing accuracy. US Topo does not portray access and travel management information indicating which trails are managed for or open to specific modes of travel (motorized/non-motorized) or associated seasons of use. USFS trails (other than selected NSTs described above) are currently shown on US Topo only in Colorado. - The International Mountain Bicycling Association, IMBA, shares their bicycle trails data with USGS as part of an ongoing partnership. IMBA-collected trails are generally not shown inside delineated Federal lands (e.g., National Forests) on US Topo maps.</othercit>

            <othercit>Dataset source is Census Bureau MAF/TIGER database extracts in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent dataset, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. The U.S. Geological Survey filters Census roads to remove short road segments which are less than 500 feet in length, are not named and are classified as local roads. The USGS National Transportation Dataset functional road classification system is applied to the Census datasets. The original TIGER/Line Shapefile products are not copyrighted however TIGER/Line and Census TIGER are registered trademarks of the U.S. Census Bureau. The horizontal spatial accuracy information present in the TIGER/Line shapefiles is provided for the purposes of statistical analysis and census operations only and the data may not be suitable for high-precision measurement applications. Full metadata for TIGER/Line shapefiles is available from U.S. Census Bureau</othercit>

        <procdesc>The data for this product are created as follows. All geospatial content is taken from national geospatial databases under the stewardship of USGS data programs. The NAIP imagery is provided by a seamless tile service that delivers image data at the resolution and quality of the source imagery. The raster and vector data, including grids and collar information, are processed using ESRI ArcGIS software and exported. Map formatting is performed using a custom application, which includes post-processing to embed the metadata XML document.</procdesc>
